# Configuration_management_and_Automate-User-Creation-and-File-Access-Control
In this project, I wrote a shell script that automates the process of creating a new user, creating a new folder, granting access , creating a newgroup, adding the user to the group and folder, granting the user sudo access, and setting appropriate file permissions.
Then using Ansible did configuration management by installing Java, Jenkins, Maven, Git, Docker, and Docker Compose. 
Pulls files from a GitHub repository, and executed the shell script on the target host.

This Script only works in Linux.
